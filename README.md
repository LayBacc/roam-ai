The AI extension for Roam. 

## Get started
- Add your own Open AI API key in the Roam Depot settings. You can [sign up for an API key here](https://openai.com/api/).
- To open the menu, type `qq` in any block.

## Capabilities
### Completion: 
Generate text based on the current block + the current tree.

### üìç Local Completion
Generate text based on the current block only.

### üîÑ Rephrase

This reads only the current block (local).

Given the children blocks, generate a label for the parent block.

## Custom models
The format for configuring custom models then looks like this:
```
[{ "name": "model A", "endpoint": "closedai.com/v1/completions", "displayName": "model A", "model": "model-001" }]
```

Note: the `endpoint` parameter is used internally by the plugin. And it's unrelated to the deprecated parameter in OpenAI's API.
