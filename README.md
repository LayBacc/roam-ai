## Custom models

The format for configuring custom models then looks like this:

```
[{ "name": "model A", "endpoint": "closedai.com/v1/completions", "displayName": "model A", "model": "model-001" }]
```

Note: the `endpoint` parameter is used internally by the plugin. And it's unrelated to the deprecated parameter in OpenAI's API.
